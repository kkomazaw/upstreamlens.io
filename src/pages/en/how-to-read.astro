    <h2>Separating Facts from Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      Each article clearly distinguishes between:
    </p>

    <h3>Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CNCF official documents</li>
      <li>Community discussions</li>
      <li>Primary sources such as issues, PRs, and statements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Structuring from the author's perspective</li>
      <li>Meaning-making</li>
      <li>Mapping to the 3-axis framework</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Readers are encouraged to reinterpret Facts within their own context.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How to Use the 3-Axis Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Articles on this site are structured along the following three axes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product</strong> — Why is it needed</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering</strong> — How to implement it</li>
      <li><strong>Organization / Architecture</strong> — How to operate and maintain it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When reading articles, being conscious of<br />
      <strong>"Along which of the three axes is this discussion taking place"</strong><br />
      makes the structure easier to see.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Reading Approach</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>First, read <a href="/en/philosophy">Philosophy</a> to understand the perspective</li>
      <li>Choose articles that interest you</li>
      <li>Verify Facts and compare with your own interpretation</li>
